# ReykjavikMarathonData
Complete results from the Reykjavik Marathon (2000, 2005 and 2010 - 2018)

This project contains my analysis of the Reykjavik marathon, which I published in three different articles on Kjarninn. 
  - see: https://kjarninn.is/category/eikonomics/https://kjarninn.is/category/eikonomics/

Project contains:
  - Raw Data (vars: brutto time, runner name, age, year of race, gender and more)
  - a Stata do-file code that I used to clean the data,
  - a clean data file (both in .dta and .csv format)
  - TBC (my analysis, once I have cleaned it)
